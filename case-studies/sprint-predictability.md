# ðŸ“ˆ Case Study: Improving Sprint Predictability

## ðŸŽ¯ Context
While working on Amazon CMT and Kindle migration projects, our team faced challenges with **inconsistent sprint outcomes**. Planned vs. Completed work often varied by more than 25%, creating uncertainty for stakeholders.

---

## ðŸš© Problem
- Frequent spillovers of stories into the next sprint.
- Lack of clarity on story readiness before sprint planning.
- Velocity fluctuations made forecasting unreliable.

---

## ðŸ”§ Actions Taken
1. **Introduced Definition of Ready (DoR)** to ensure backlog items were well-refined before planning.
2. Facilitated **backlog refinement workshops** with Product Owners and SMEs.
3. Used **velocity dashboard & burndown charts** to visualize trends and drive conversations in retrospectives.
4. Encouraged the team to **split large stories into smaller, testable increments**.

---

## âœ… Outcome
- Sprint predictability improved from **~75% to ~95%** within 3 sprints.
- Spillover rate reduced by **40%**.
- Stakeholders gained confidence in delivery commitments.
- Team felt less pressure during the last sprint days â†’ improved morale.

---

## ðŸ“Š Supporting Metrics
- **Velocity trend** stabilized around 31 SP (up from inconsistent 22â€“34 SP).
- **Burndown charts** showed smoother progress with fewer mid-sprint spikes.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- Enforcing **Definition of Ready** helps reduce uncertainty.
- Data-driven discussions in retrospectives build trust.
- Predictability matters more than raw velocity.
