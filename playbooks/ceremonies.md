# Ceremony Facilitation Guide  

This guide explains how I facilitate Scrum ceremonies:  

- **Daily Standups** – Timeboxed to 15 mins, focusing on progress & impediments.  
- **Sprint Planning** – Story point estimation, capacity planning.  
- **Retrospectives** – Example techniques: Start-Stop-Continue, Sailboat, 4Ls.  
- **Sprint Reviews** – Demo outcomes, collect feedback.
