# 📌 Definition of Ready (DoR) – Amazon CMT & Kindle Project (Sample)  

The **Definition of Ready (DoR)** is the set of conditions a backlog item must meet before the team commits to delivering it in a sprint.  
This ensures clarity, reduces ambiguity, and improves sprint predictability.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To ensure backlog items (user stories, tasks, or mapping rules) are well-defined, estimated, and testable before sprint planning.  

---

## 🛠️ General DoR Criteria (Stories / Tasks)  
- [ ] User story has **clear description** and business value documented.  
- [ ] Acceptance criteria written in testable form (e.g., Given-When-Then).  
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved (e.g., catalog feed availability, ISBN dataset).  
- [ ] Size estimated and within a sprint’s capacity (no oversized stories).  
- [ ] Story priority confirmed in backlog (ranked by PO).  
- [ ] Test data or mock catalog records available for validation.

## 📦 Additional DoR – Catalog Mapping Automation (CMT)  
- [ ] Source data (competitor catalog extracts) available and verified.  
- [ ] Target Amazon catalog attributes clarified (e.g., edition, platform, language).  
- [ ] Mapping/regex rules defined and peer-reviewed.  
- [ ] Validation method agreed (automation test vs. manual sampling).
