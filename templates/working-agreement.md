# 📝 Team Working Agreement  

This document represents a **sample team working agreement** that I use when facilitating new Scrum teams.  
Working agreements are living documents, created collaboratively, and revisited regularly to ensure team alignment.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To establish **shared expectations** on how we work together, collaborate, and deliver value as a team.  

---

## 🤝 Communication & Collaboration  
- Daily Standup at **8:00 PM**, timeboxed to 15 minutes.  
- Use **Slack/Chime** for quick updates; Jira comments for work-related discussions.  
- Cameras **on** for ceremonies (where possible) to encourage engagement.  
- Respect focus hours: 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM (no non-urgent meetings).  

---

## 🛠️ Workflow & Commitments  
- Stories must meet the **Definition of Ready (DoR)** before sprint planning.  
- Tasks should be **updated in Jira daily** for visibility.  
- No work is considered complete unless it meets the **Definition of Done (DoD)**.  
- Limit Work in Progress (WIP) to **2 items per developer**.  

---

## 📊 Decision-Making  
- Strive for **consensus** in retrospectives and planning.  
- In case of a tie, the **Product Owner** makes the final call on backlog priorities.  
- Technical decisions made collaboratively with input from senior engineers.  

---

## 🌱 Continuous Improvement  
- Retrospectives held **every sprint**; at least 1 actionable improvement item added to backlog.  
- Encourage psychological safety: all voices matter, no blame culture.  
- Celebrate small wins and recognize contributions openly.  

---

## 🔄 Agreement Maintenance  
- This agreement will be **reviewed at the start of every PI** (or quarterly).  
- Updates must be agreed upon by the entire team.

✅ *This is a **template** — in real projects, I co-create the agreement with my team during Sprint 0 or project kickoff.*
